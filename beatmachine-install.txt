What does beatmachine do?
* You provide a solvable Classic Turing Machine problem, and the 
software gives you the number of rounds and questions a seasoned solo 
player needs to solve it.
* The software is a CLI, command line interface program, requiring 
very little from your computer: The keyboard, a terminal window, 
execution permission, and you having access to the Turing Machine 
boardgame and its websites.
* Edit a JSON file following the syntax outlined below. Provide this 
filename as an argument to the software:
> cat A43_Y6L.json
{"name":"#A43 Y6L", "verifiers":[{"card":4,"verif":447}, 
{"card":9,"verif":646}, {"card":11,"verif":566}, 
{"card":14,"verif":322}]}
> ./beatmachine-latest-x86_64.AppImage A43_Y6L.json
#A43 Y6L: I found the code in 1 round(s) and 2 question(s).

Hardware:
* The "beatmachine" software is provided for Linux x86_64 and AMD 
computers (Intel and Ryzen chips, and some others) in an "AppImage" 
executable file format, not as source code.
* The software shall be downloaded and run locally on your Linux home 
PC.

Download:
* The AppImage file is currently distributed from a public GitHub 
repository. Visit https://github.com/gaaloe/Applications, hit Go To 
File, select the beatmachine*.AppImage, locate the dropdown menu 
marked with three dots, Download to your local machine.

Install:
* The AppImage format needs very little from your environment. The 
fuse or fuse2 library (Filesystem in Userspace) must be installed, 
that's all. If installation is needed use the ordinary Linux package 
updater as root user.
> sudo apt-get install fuse
* In your local repository: Set the +x execution permission on the 
beatmachine*.AppImage file:
> chmod u+x beatmachine*.AppImage
* No on-line server, graphics, deamons, ports, root access or special 
users is needed. Compare this to Docker images and SNAP files and you 
shuld be horrified of what they require.
* Hardly any disk space (4.8 MByte) is needed. You can easily remove 
the AppImage file, and nothing remains (unless things mentioned here 
or in the help text).

Running:
* Start the "beatmachine" executable in your local directory where 
the file resides after download:
> ./beatmachine-latest-x86_64_*.AppImage
* Provide the --help argument and follow the instructions.
