What does beatmachine do?
* You provide a solvable Classic Turing Machine problem, and the 
software gives you the proposals, the answers to the proposals, and 
the number of rounds and questions a seasoned solo player needs to 
solve it.
* The software is a CLI, command line interface program, requiring 
very little from your computer: The keyboard, a terminal window, 
execution permission, and you having access to the Turing Machine 
boardgame and its websites.
* Input is done in form of a JSON file following the syntax outlined 
below. Provide a filename as an argument to the software.

Hardware:
* The "beatmachine" software is provided for Linux x86_64 and AMD 
computers (Intel and Ryzen chips, and some others) in an "AppImage" 
executable file format, not as source code.

Download:
* The software shall be downloaded and run locally on your Linux home 
PC.
* The AppImage file is currently distributed from a public GitHub 
repository. Visit https://github.com/gaaloe/Applications, hit Go To 
File, select the beatmachine*.AppImage, locate the dropdown menu 
marked with three dots, Download to your local machine.

Install:
* The AppImage format needs very little from your environment. The 
fuse or fuse3 library (Filesystem in USErspace, 3: use the highest 
numbered available) must be installed, that's all. If installation is 
needed use the ordinary Linux package updater as root.
> apt list --installed | grep fuse3
> sudo apt-get install fuse3
* In your local repository: Set the +x execution permission on the 
beatmachine*.AppImage file:
> chmod u+x beatmachine*.AppImage
* No on-line server, graphics, deamons, ports, root access or special 
users is needed. Compare this to Docker images and SNAP files and you 
shuld be horrified of what they require.
* Hardly any disk space (4.8 MByte) is needed. You can easily remove 
the AppImage file, and nothing remains (unless things mentioned here 
or in the help text).

Running:
* Start the "beatmachine" executable in your local directory where 
the file resides after download:
> ./beatmachine-latest-x86_64_*.AppImage
* Provide the --help argument and follow the instructions.
