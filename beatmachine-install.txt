What does beatmachine do?
* You provide a solvable Classic Turing Machine problem, and the 
software gives you the proposals, the answers to the proposals, and 
the number of rounds and questions a seasoned solo player needs to 
solve it.
* The software is a CLI, command line interface program, requiring 
very little from your computer: The keyboard, a terminal window, 
execution permission, and you having access to the Turing Machine 
boardgame and it's websites.
* Input is done in form of a JSON file following the syntax outlined 
below. Provide a filename as an argument to the software, or provide 
the JSON within a pair of quotes.

#A43 Y6L: I found the code in 1 round(s) and 2 question(s).

Packaging:
* The "beatmachine" software is provided in "AppImage" executable 
file format, or as Docker images, not as source code. You must 
possess enough computer knowledge regarding AppImage or Docker image 
to proceed further. If you don't, acquire more knowledge before 
continuing! AppImages are the easiest.

Hardware:
* The "beatmachine" software is provided for Linux x86_64 and AMD 
computers (Intel and Ryzen chips, and some others) and for ARM 32-bit 
(like Raspberry Pi). You can use Windows WSL 2 as well.

Download:
* The software shall be downloaded and run locally on your home PC.
* The AppImage file is currently distributed from a public GitHub 
repository. Visit https://github.com/gaaloe/Applications, hit Go To 
File, select the beatmachine*.AppImage, locate the dropdown menu 
marked with three dots, Download to your local machine.
* It is not necessary to use Git. But if you do, you need Git LFS as 
well.
* You can not download using wget.
* The Docker image file is pulled from Docker Hub, see "docker pull 
gaaloe/beatmachine-*", see https://hub.docker.com/repositories/gaaloe

Install:
* The AppImage format needs very little from your environment. The 
fuse or fuse3 library (Filesystem in USErspace, 3: use the highest 
numbered available) must be installed, that's all. If installation is 
needed use the ordinary Linux package updater as root.
> apt list --installed | grep fuse
> sudo apt-get install fuse (...or...)
> sudo apt-get install fuse3
* If using Windows WSL 2:
> sudo apt-get install libfuse2
* In your local repository: Set the +x execution permission on the 
beatmachine*.AppImage file:
> chmod u+x beatmachine*.AppImage
* To install the Docker image, see the documentation of installing a 
docker runtime service. Then:
> docker pull gaaloe/beatmachine-amd64
> docker pull gaaloe/beatmachine-arm32v7

Running AppImage:
* Start the "beatmachine" executable in your local directory where 
the file resides after download:
> ./beatmachine-x86_64_*.AppImage
* Provide the --help argument and follow the instructions.

Running docker image:
> docker run gaaloe/beatmachine-amd64
* Provide the --help argument and follow the instructions.
